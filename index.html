                    according to Gorillaz co-creator Damon Albarn, it was recorded quickly so the band would have new
                    material to play at future concerts. The album spawned six singles, including "Humility" ( the lead
                    single), "Hollywood" and "Tranz". The Now Now debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and at
                    number five on the UK Albums Chart.

                        The story of Gorillaz begins on August 15th, 198. Stu-Pot was a mentally deficient keyboard
                        enthusiast and part-time emloyee at Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium. Satanist hoodlum Murdoc Niccals
                        decided to ram-raid Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium to procure synthesizer equipment in order to
                        establish a"chart-topping" musical group. However, Murdoc ended up driving his Vauxhall Astra
                        through the building and directly into Stu-Pot's head, permanently damaging
                        ("fracturing")Stu-Pot's
                        left eye and putting him into a catatonic state.Murdoc was sentenced to"30,000 hours of
                        community
                        service,plus 10 hours every week of caring for the injured Stu-Pot".

                    <p class="description2">
                        Not long after , Murdoc again injured Stu-Pot in a car accident in Nottingham's Tesco car park
                        when
                        attempting a 360° in order to impress some women. During the initial rotaion, he was thrown
                        through
                        the windshield and landed face-first on a curb. This permanently damaged Stu-Pot's right eye but
                        revived him from his coma. Impressed by Stu-Pot's new look, Murdoc then recruited the newly
                        recovered ( albeit still mentally defective) Stu-Pot as the keyboardist and vocalist for his
                        group,
                        re-dubbing him 2-D for the matching pair of dents in his head from the accidents.

                        burned down the ruins of Kong Studios, cashed in on the insurance money and blamed the fire on

                        to flee from deadly underground network of pirates simply referred to as "The Black Clouds", who
                        were out to kill him after their business deal went south. Though this isn't the first time the

                        business with Murdoc before, which also went south. This led to the Black Clouds being the

                        the insurance money to build a new Gorillaz HQ on top, renaming the island, "Plastic Beach".

                        a secret prison beneath Abbey Road Studios. Murdoc was eventually released under the condition
                        that he was to immediately begin work on a new Gorillaz album. Murdoc agreed and moved into a

                        During a brief hiatus for the band, on the 3rd of September 2019 while visiting Iran to see Lake
                        Urmia, Noodle made note of how climate change had taken a toll on the lake. She came to a
                        realization regarding the fleeting state of nature on earth and sent a postcard to Murdoc, 2-D,
                        and Russel at Studio 13 with a message detailing her desire to build a machine and see the world
                        before it's gone. The postcard arrived at Studio 13 on the 12th of September.

                        On the 7th of September, 2-D sent a postcard to the band while visiting Beirut, informing Noodle
                        that he got the parts for the machine she had mentioned, asking what they were for. The postcard
                        arrived at Studio 13 on the 24th of September. <br>

                        During July 2022, the band announced that they had begun recording their next album in Silver
                        Lake, Los Angeles while the London Sewage Department continued Kong's restoration. During this
                        time Murdoc became increasingly interested in the occult, and eventually founded a cult focusing
                        on the supernatural, dubbed The Last Cult. The rest of the band weren't too keen but didn't
                        think much of it.

                        2-D was given the role of "The Chosen One", and started a podcast as a way to journal the first
                        days of The Last Cult.[27]Over time, 2-D talked about various tasks he'd been assigned including
                        digging holes, painting Murdoc's giant obelisk, finding books for Noodle, as well as the
                        activities of the neighbours, mainly the "main lady" next door, who seemed to fancy 2-D, and
                        Murdoc became attracted to. It was also implied that Murdoc may have started the cult simply in
                        an attempt to impress her.
